# \brief Read a binary data file from the SB2030 data logger
#
# The WIBL data file contains binary data packets that can encapsulate either specific
# NMEA2000 data packets (translated into a simpler format), or wrap a NMEA0183 sentence
# for later intepretation; some metadata and auxiliary packets are also allowed.  In order
# to do something useful, however, we need to read those packets into memory, and then
# fix up the timestamps associated with the packets in the case where they have not been
# added automatically by the logger (this doesn't happen with WIBL loggers, but can be the
# case where other loggers have their data translated into WIBL format for processing and
# submission to DCDB).

## Encapsulate the types of real-world time information that can be used
#
# In order to establish the relationship between the elapsed time (i.e., time of reception) of
# each packet and the real-world time, we need to use the encoded timestamps in one of the
# packets in the file.  There are a number of choices for this, depending on what type of
# data we have in there; this enumeration provides a controlled list of the options.

    ## Use NMEA0183 RMC minimum data with timestamps
    Time_RMC = 3


## Work out which time source in the WIBL file should be used for real time associations
#
# WIBL files have an elapsed time associated with each packet that tags the time of reception
# of the packet according to the local oscillator (which might not be reliable, but at least
# is monotonic).  There are multiple potential ways to assign a correspondence between these
# timestamps and a real-world time, which depend on the types of packets that we have in the
# file.  This code selects which of several sources is likely to be best.

# estimate statistics on how many packets have been read, and of what types (and if they have
